# Employee-tracker

## Description

![employee tracker](/Images/Employee_manager.jpg)
This project is about creating a employee tracker so that the use can easily navigate through a database to see employee information as well as being able to add to the database and update roles for the employees. This project is especially useful when all employee information as well as role information and department information is entered into the database for a company. The project incorporates npm modules of inquirer and mysql. The inquirer module allows the files to ask the user questions and retrieve the information inputted. The mysql module allows for communication with the database. 


This javascript code incorporates npm modules that commincate with websites and various other packages that make many javascipt functionalities easier to create. For this instance, we were able to retrieve information from a database and display it neatly on the termnial. We were able to do this by using SQL queries and knowing what SQL queries to use by asking the user.
